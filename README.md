# Swift Strike - Sneaker Store Website

Welcome to the **Swift Strike** project, a stylish and user-friendly website dedicated to bringing you the latest in sneaker culture, fashion, and performance. We're passionate about sneakers and aim to offer an unparalleled shopping experience with a curated selection of top-quality products from iconic brands.

## Project Overview
Swift Strike is a responsive e-commerce website designed to showcase and sell limited-edition sneakers. This project is created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and focuses on providing users with an intuitive, easy-to-navigate platform. It includes:

- A homepage with carousel and featured products
- A contact page with contact details and a message form
- An about page providing insight into the company
- A product listing page for sneakers, including descriptions and links to buy

## Current Status
This project is still in progress. We are working on adding a database to handle products, customer information, and transactions more efficiently. As of now, product details are hard-coded, and we are focusing on the front-end development. The next major step will be integrating a database for better data management and interaction.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The site adapts to various screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Dynamic Content:** The homepage carousel features dynamic, eye-catching images and product promotions.
- **Interactive Elements:** Users can navigate easily through the store with well-organized links and intuitive buttons.

## Technologies Used

## Future Improvements
